# Natural-Language-Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers interact with humans in natural language. It involves enabling machines to:
•	Understand spoken or written text
•	Interpret meaning, context, and emotion
•	Generate responses or new text naturally
Common examples of NLP include:
•	Chatbots and virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
•	Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
•	Sentiment analysis (e.g., analyzing customer reviews)
•	Text summarization
•	Speech recognition
•	Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This repository explores NLP, a field at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Linguistics, and Computer Science. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
The goal of this project is to provide an accessible, practical, and structured introduction to NLP concepts, techniques, and applications. Whether you’re a beginner or an intermediate learner, this repository offers hands-on examples, tutorials, and useful resources to get started.
